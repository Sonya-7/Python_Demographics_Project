# Python_Demographics_Project

This project was created to collect demographic data from students attending an exercise convention.

The code is Python Programing Language. It uses the DATETIME package. It also uses lists, touples, dictionaries, if statements, for loops, while loop...

The interactive version of this code is stored in a Jupiter Notebook and can be accessed through my [Kaggle account](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sonyalawrence/first-python-project).

Do enjoy! I hope to make much more interesting and complex projects in the future.
